# DC-GA-DTH-Results
DC + GA DTH Approach results.

The DC + GA DTH Approach are based on the DC + GA from : Kampouridis,  M.  and  Otero,  F.E.,  (2017).  Evolving  trading  strategiesusing directional changes.Expert Systems with Applications,73, pp.145-160.

The two first files show the results of the DC + GA DTH Approach with a pool of respectivly 1000 and 10000 threshold values, when the numbers of threshold in each candidate solution are evolved by the GA.

The other six show the results of the DC + GA DTH Approach with a pool of 2000 threshold values, when the numbers of threshold in each candidate solution are fixed (respectivly 1, 2, 5, 10 ,20 and 50 thresholds).
